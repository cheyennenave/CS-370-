This project was about an intelligent agent doing a Treasure Hunt. It was given an 8X8 matrix to navigate and was given a +1 reward each time it successfully went in the right direction. The intelligent agent successfully solved the maze and produced a map displaying such.

**What do Computer Scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer Scientists use their acquired skills to develop and design solutions to technological problems. These problems can affect every facet of modern day living, including finance, business, social platforms, educational institutions, and more. In today's world, everything is based on technology. There are few things left that do not rely on technology to work. It is vital that Computer Scientists apply what they know in what ways they can to keep society functioning.

**How do I approach a problem as a Computer Scientist?**

Facing problems as a Computer Scientist is similar to solving problems in our day to day lives. We must approach the problem with an open mind and understanding. The problem must be studied to be grasped. Then, we find the root of the problem and divide it into workable parts. Once the root is established and divided, we begin crafting a solution that is maintainable for future updates. This can include creating a database to house data or writing an algorithm to efficiently produce the outcome needed.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization?**

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization is to provide clean, working software in which the user can effortlessly and satisfactorily use as well as upholding the reputation of the organization. Trustworthiness, timeliness, responsibility, integrity, and respect are key pillars in accomplishing these responsibilities well, and I plan to fine-tune those traits within myself to be a reliable Computer Scientist.
